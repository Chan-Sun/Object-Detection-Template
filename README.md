## Object Detection Project Template
___

This is my template structure for object detection task of mmdetection, mainly learned from [mim-best-practice](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mim-example), soft-teacher and k-net source code.

My goal is building a object detection template project starting from environment construction, which will save much time when facing a new task, working in a new machine or participating in a new competition.

This repo also includes some useful codes writen by myself or slightly modified from mmdet source code, such as train-val split, voc2coco, fewshot data generation, high resolution image slice and some post-analysis code.

I will complete this template in the following days. If you are insterested in this repo, please stay tuned.
